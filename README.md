Face Recognition with CBAM and ArcFace
This project implements a deep learning model for face recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module), and ArcFace for face classification. The model achieves 100% accuracy on the given dataset for classifying faces.

Overview
The face recognition system is designed to classify faces from the provided dataset, which includes 487 individuals. The model utilizes a CNN architecture combined with CBAM for enhanced feature extraction and an ArcFace loss function for better angular margin classification. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and the model is implemented using PyTorch.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Face Identification Dataset. It contains images of 487 different individuals and is sourced from Kaggle.

Model Components
1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
A CNN is employed for extracting features from input images. It learns hierarchical patterns and representations from the dataset that are crucial for face recognition.

2. CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module)
The CBAM module is used to refine feature maps through channel and spatial attention. This enhances the model's ability to focus on important regions and channels of the input data.

CBAM Implementation: The implementation is taken from the GitHub repository by Jongchan.

3. ArcFace
The ArcFace loss function is used to compute the angular margin between class features, providing more discriminative feature representations for face recognition. The implementation of ArcFace is adapted from a Kaggle notebook by parthdhameliya77.
